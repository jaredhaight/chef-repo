Learning Chef. The goal is to build a recipe that installs Nginx, Django and Postgres and then checks out the production code for Photos and Text. 

Currently working:
==================
* Install and configure Nginx
* Setup virtualenv
* Install django, uwsgi
* Setup uwsgi service


Needs work
==========
* Install and configure Postgress
* Download Photos and Text from Github
* Probably some other stuff too.
